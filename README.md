# Project Background

Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing healthcare equity, provided a comprehensive patient dataset to examine disparities in metastatic cancer diagnosis timelines. Iâ€™m partnering with healthcare data analysts and clinical operations teams to identify demographic and environmental factors that may delay timely cancer diagnosis. The goal is to deliver actionable insights that can help healthcare providers, insurance companies, and public health organizations reduce barriers to early detection and ensure equitable access to cancer care across diverse patient populations.
