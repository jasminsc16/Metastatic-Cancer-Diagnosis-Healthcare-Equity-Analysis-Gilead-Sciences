# Project Background

Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing healthcare equity, provided a comprehensive patient dataset to examine disparities in metastatic cancer diagnosis timelines. I’m partnering with healthcare data analysts and clinical operations teams to identify demographic and environmental factors that may delay timely cancer diagnosis. The goal is to deliver actionable insights that can help healthcare providers, insurance companies, and public health organizations reduce barriers to early detection and ensure equitable access to cancer care across diverse patient populations.

The Python code used to create the cleaned analysis dataset, perform the exploratory data analysis/variable selection, complete the train-test split, and evaluate different models such as decision tree regressor and histogram-based gradient boosting regressor can be found here: [Metastatic Cancer Diagnosis Analysis](https://github.com/jasminsc16/Metastatic-Cancer-Diagnosis-Healthcare-Equity-Gilead-Sciences/blob/main/Metastatic%20Cancer%20Diagnosis%20Healthcare%20Equity%20Analysis%20Gilead%20Sciences.ipynb)

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

•	**Patient Demographics**: Evaluation of demographic factors: age, gender, and race/ethnicity to identify potential disparities.

•	**Socioeconomic Factors**: An analysis of factors such as income levels, education, poverty rates, employment, homeownership, and rent burden to evaluate how economic barriers correlate with healthcare delays.

•	**Environmental Factors**: An assessment of monthly temperature averages (climate pattern) to determine if climate may impact healthcare-seeking behavior or cancer prevention.

•	**Clinical Characteristics and Healthcare Access**: An analysis of factors such as payer type (of insurance) and health_uninsured rate to assess patients’ direct access to care.

•	**Geographic Comparisons**: An evaluation of patient distribution across state, region, division, population density, and rural vs. urban characteristics to investigate location’s influence on healthcare infrastructure availability.
