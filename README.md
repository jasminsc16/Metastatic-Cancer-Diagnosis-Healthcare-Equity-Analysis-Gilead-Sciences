# Project Background

Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing healthcare equity, provided a comprehensive patient dataset to examine disparities in metastatic cancer diagnosis timelines. Iâ€™m partnering with healthcare data analysts and clinical operations teams to identify demographic and environmental factors that may delay timely cancer diagnosis. The goal is to deliver actionable insights that can help healthcare providers, insurance companies, and public health organizations reduce barriers to early detection and ensure equitable access to cancer care across diverse patient populations.

The Python code used to create the cleaned analysis dataset, perform the exploratory data analysis/variable selection, complete the train-test split, and evaluate different models such as decision tree regressor and histogram-based gradient boosting regressor can be found here: [Metastatic Cancer Diagnosis Analysis](https://github.com/jasminsc16/Metastatic-Cancer-Diagnosis-Healthcare-Equity-Gilead-Sciences/blob/main/Metastatic%20Cancer%20Diagnosis%20Healthcare%20Equity%20Analysis%20Gilead%20Sciences.ipynb)
